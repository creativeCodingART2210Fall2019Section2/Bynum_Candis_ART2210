For my final project, I decided to recreate my game project and from a quiz game to a game like Simon Says. To play, the game will show you a pattern and you would have to recreate the same pattern in order to win. I was inspired by my childhood since this was one of my favorite games to play when I was little.  To code, I had to create two separate files, one file is for squares and one file is for the actual game code that includes the score, the random pattern and the end of the game.
